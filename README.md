# make8bitart

[make8bitart.com](http://make8bitart.com) is a web-based pixel art application that's super fun and easy and free to use!

## install

Just download the source and direct your browser to the `index.html` of the project root directory. It's just HTML, JavaScript and CSS, so no need for a special server setup.

## contribute

Aw yiss, pull requests welcome, but first check out the issues for things I want to work on and holler if you want to take one or whatever on. When you download, run `npm install` and then `grunt` to build. Grunt is used to concatenate and minify the js and css files into the build folder. All build files should be pushed to the repo, so anyone can download and start drawing even if they don't have node!

## dev dependencies

make8bitart.com uses jQuery and a jQuery plugins I wrote: [draggybits](https://github.com/jennschiffer/draggybits). grunt is used for the build.

## misc notes

8-bit truthers will complain that the color palette is not actually 8-bit. If that makes you really angry, then I suggest you take a nap, butthorn.

This is an agile development cycle, so I'm poppin' in features as I come up with them or as folks request them. Expect changes here often, and do not be shocked to find gross code. If you have suggestions, I'm totally open to hear them and learn if you're not a nerf dart about it!

## made with &hearts;&hearts;&hearts; by jenn schiffer

I designed, built, and created all of the graphics for this passion project. The dinosaur art in the source was found through a variety of geocities websites. The code and the graphics are open source!

If you have feature requests, create an Issue to start the discussion!
